FACE-RECOGNITON




DESCRIPTION -
Hey peeps nimo here, this project is one the best project i made, so this project works on the face recognition and opencv library in python. 
When working if it detects a pre-given face it will start to beep and if it doesn't recognize the person, it will just say its unknown instead of beeping.

pip3 install face-recognition

pip3 install opencv-python

pip3 install numpy

pip3 install playsound


USAGE -
You can use this project for home security, install it on a raspberry pi and
then integrate with the cameras and the smart lock so they will only allow only recognised faces.
